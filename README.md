# Filament Static Asset Handling
This package aims to solve improve the static asset handling of the amazing Laravel package [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/). 

---

**NOTE:** This package is for Filament served assets only. If you are looking for a general Laravel asset management system that includes
the same features as this, plus advanced dependency management, then the newly released [Laravel Static Libraries](https://github.com/HollyIT/laravel-static-libraries) might be of interest. 

---

By default Filament serves all static files (js and css) via Laravel. While this method is
perfectly fine for smaller projects, it can become a performance hit once your project grows.
To overcome the performance hit, this package will copy all your static assets to a path in
your public directory, thereby allowing your webserver to directly handle the files. If
you add a package with new files and forget run the command, no sweat, things will fallback
directly to Filament's default handling.

Another feature of the caching mechanism is the addition of cache buster keys added to the
actual URLs. These keys are based off of the filemtime of the original asset file, so even
if you republish, browser caching will remain untouched.

To cache your static files, just run this simple command:

```bash
 php artisan filament:cache-assets
```

And to clear the files out, going back to the original method of handling files:

```bash
 php artisan filament:flush-assets
 ```

One problem with this method is that you may easily forget to run the commands when packages
are updated. Therefor it is highly recommended to add a script to your composer.json file to
handle this automatically:
```json
    "scripts": {
        "post-autoload-dump": [
            "Illuminate\\Foundation\\ComposerScripts::postAutoloadDump",
            "@php artisan package:discover --ansi"
        ],
        "post-update-cmd": [
            "@php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-assets --ansi --force",
            "@php artisan filament:upgrade",
            "@php artisan filament:cache-assets" // Add this line
        ],

        "post-root-package-install": [
            "@php -r \"file_exists('.env') || copy('.env.example', '.env');\""
        ],
        "post-create-project-cmd": [
            "@php artisan key:generate --ansi"
        ]
    },
```
The second problem this package deals with is the loading of assets on every page. As projects grow
and more static assets are added, this can be another performance hit. If you use a package like
the [Filament Tiptap Edito](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/tiptap)r or [Filament Tiny Editor](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/tinyeditor), then those files load on every page,
regardless of you needing them or not. To stop this, there are two events fired when rendering
out scripts and stylesheets:

#### HollyIT\FilamentStaticAssets\Events\PreProcessStaticAssetsEvent 

This event is fired before the files are processed and things like cache busting keys are added.

#### HollyIT\FilamentStaticAssets\Events\PostProcessStaticAssetsEvent

This event fires after all alterations are done to the files and ready to be rendered in the template.

Both methods expose the same properties:

`$event->files` is a collection of the actual files. So in the PreProcess event, you could remove a script 
file: `$event->files->forget('file_to_drop');`

`$event->domain` is the scope of the files. This can be either styles, scripts or beforeCoreScripts

## Install

```bash
composer require hollyit/filament-static-assets
```

## One Note!

To make all this possible, this package has to override the FilamentManager class provided by Filament. So If
you are trying to do anything extra with that concrete class, keep in mind you'll have to echo the changes
made by this class.

## Testing
This package is fully tested with 100% coverage.
